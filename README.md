# Media Showcase

A modern, responsive web page that showcases audio and video content. This project was built to demonstrate a foundational understanding of embedding external media, managing player states with JavaScript, and creating a dynamic, animated layout with modern CSS.

### Key Features

* **Responsive Layout:** The design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, using a CSS grid for the media cards and a staggered layout for a unique visual experience.
* **Integrated YouTube API:** The project uses the YouTube IFrame Player API to manage video playback, allowing only one video to play at a time.
* **Local Media Playback:** The page includes a collection of local audio files with custom-styled controls to match the dark theme.
* **Animations and Dark Theme:** The design features a cohesive dark theme with smooth animations for a modern and engaging user experience.
* **Semantic HTML:** The page is structured with modern HTML5 semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
